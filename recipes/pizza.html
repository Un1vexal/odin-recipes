<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Are you someone who sticks to the typical pizza flavors or do you wanna try a favor combination that is out of this work. I remember the first time i tired a slice of this pizza and oh man was i surprised by that taste. 
    Smokey bacon, pieces of chicken, gooey melty cheese, and creamy ranch were the perfect combo to pile on a chewy crust! My first problem i was went to a place that over did it, they didn't know how to harmonize the favors and one or the other would begin to overpower it. Now this recipe is far from perfect but it taste better than most pizza shop pizzas</p>
